# nhl-fantasy-drafter
A VBA tool to assist with NHL fantasy draft choices.

Instructions:
* Find and copy the stats from the last 3 years into the "year1/2/3" tabs (with the most recent year going into year1). Note: the default spreadsheet uses 2019/2020, 2018/2019 & 2017/2018 data.
* Enter the point values for your league below; if it's a categories league, use the proportion calculator to determine the value of each stat.
* Run the macro in the "Rankings" tab to determine the value of each player.
* During the draft, keep track of drafted players by highlighting their names in red in the "Rankings" tab. When it is your turn to pick, run the macro in the "RemainingPlayers" tab to filter for the top skater selection.
